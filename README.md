### Project Overview

- **Data Collection Process**: We used the GitHub API to collect user and repository data for users in Shanghai with over 200 followers.
- **Insights**: We observed that certain repository characteristics, such as stars, vary widely, indicating different levels of influence.
- **Recommendation**: Developers can use follower counts to identify key community members for collaboration and project visibility.
